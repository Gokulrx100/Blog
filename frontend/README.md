## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blog.git
cd blog/frontend
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure environment variables (if needed)

If your frontend needs to know the backend API URL, create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory:

```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

Update your API calls in the code to use this variable if required.

### 4. Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will run on `http://localhost:5173` by default (or another port if specified).
